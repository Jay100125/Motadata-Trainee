# Multithreading
- extends thread class or implement runnable interface
- if you are implementing runnable then you have to create new object of thread and pass that class in constructor then start thread using t1.start();
- if you are directly extending thread class then use obj.start() method
- methods
  - setDemons :- ignore it
